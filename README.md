# Face-detection-and-recognition-using-Python-OpenCV
This project detects as well as recognizes the faces based on the trained data. Here CascadeClassifier is used for face detection and Local binary patterns histograms (LBPH) Face Recognizer is used for face recognition

Please add the training data in the same location as the Notebook with each persons data inside a folder with name of a folder starting with p (p for person)
For eg: Training-Data\\p1\\Image.jpg will be path of a image of a person

Also put the file lbpcascade_frontalface.xml in the same location as the notebook which is used for face detection

#Requirements for the project
1. Python version 3.7 and more
2. Opencv installed with python


#Steps
1.Install Python 3.7 and install opencv 
2.Generate and keep the dataset for training purpose of model
3.Detect faces from the dataset and feed the data to train the model Local binary patterns histograms (LBPH) Face Recognizer
4.Once training is done feed the test images and see the results
